# Quanser 3D DOF for Attitude Estimation Comparison

This project consist of the software modules for the evaluation of visual-inertial algorithms for attitude estimation, using the [Quanser 3D DOF hover](https://www.quanser.com/products/3-dof-hover/) [1] as a test bed. This project is part of the work: [Comparative Evaluation of Filtering Methods in an Experimental Visual-Inertial Attitude Determination Setup](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321505855_Comparative_Evaluation_of_Filtering_Methods_in_an_Experimental_Visual-Inertial_Attitude_Determination_Setup) [2].

The hardware consist of: 

- the Quanser 3D DOF hover;
- a Inertial Measurement Unity (IMU), composed by a 3-axis acceleremoter and rate-gyro as hardware platform;
- a RGB monocular camera. 

The Quanser 3 DOF Hover is a testbed that simulates the flight dynamics and control of vertical lift-off vehicles and can be operated with Matlab and Simulink. It is characterized by:

1. Three degrees of freedom (3 DOF) â€“ body rotates about pitch and yaw axes;
2. Precise, stiff and heavy-duty machined components;
3. Propellers driven by high-quality Pittman DC motors;
4. High-resolution optical encoders for precise position measurements; 
5. Slip ring allows infinite motion about the yaw axis. 

The high-resolution optical encoders [1] allows the evaluation of attitude estimation algorithms, by comparing the estimation with the encoders, a detailed explanation is provied in [2].
